based on the picture above, user interface and user experience is placed inside of customer experience. It means that UI and UX are part of customer experience.
Why we have differences between customer and user ? because they have siginificant differences.

<br/>
### Customer : performing transaction
<br/>
### User : People who interact with our product. User is our customer canditate, so we have opportunity to convert them to be our loyal customer.

There's huge different between customer experience and customer service.

Customer Experience can be call center, mobile (if the business has mobile app or can be another app, depend on the enterprise), Social media, Email, etc.
