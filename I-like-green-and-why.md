# I like green and why

======================
I'm really thankfull because github pages provide us a beautifull theme. Thanks for Jekyll for creating this beautifull theme and decided to choose green as based color.

When I was child, I wasn't really into green. I used to like red, as to me "red" had really powerfull meaning. It's shining, different, brave, eye catching, and anothers meaning that difficult to explain because this color was really different to me before.
But my journey didn't end up on that way, when I continued my study to the next class level, I was thinking that red was no longer my favorite color, it's too brave and I wasn't fit with that atmosfir.

So, I was moved to see another color, and my heart was beating in orange. I thought, it's fit to me. 

But not too long, my choice was changed and all of me as like telling myself that green is me. 
It makes me feel calm, relaxe, happy and another positive feeling.
I love green so much, but I dont't use green for my daily outfit haha
And I've several criteria which kind of green that I like.

I still like green :)
